A "photo frame" app with the simplest possible drag and drop support. Has a single image view which
accepts drops on one tab, and another tab with a few example photos.

Features:

* Registering drag sources (example photos)
* Registering drop targets (the photo frame)
* Two-handed navigation: Grab a photo with one hand, and tap the tab bar to navigate to the photo frame.
