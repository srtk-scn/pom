# align

Align demonstrates and tests the various align and text-align properties.  There are some complications with respect to the interplay between align and layout (horizontal-align only works in vertical layouts and vice-versa), and in the effect of text-align (is scoped within the label widget boundaries).

See the code and the comments therein, in relation to what it actually produces, to see what's going on.
