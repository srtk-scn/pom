# GiRl

This is a simple demo of how to use the Gi Render library outside of GoGi: [girl](https://github.com/goki/gi/tree/master/girl).

Compared to the widely-used https://github.com/fogleman/gg upon which GiRl is based, the primary advantages include:

* Use of https://github.com/srwiley/rasterx and SVG / CSS styles to provide more SVG-compliant rendering, that is also fast.  Supports color gradients etc.

* Full-featured HTML-styled text layout and rendering, which is significantly more advanced than what is present in the gg system.
